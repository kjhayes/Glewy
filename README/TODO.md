#Glewy TODO

-Make Shaders a class and an Asset<>
-Make animations an Asset<>
-Come up with distinct naming convention for functions which return a pointer and ownership of said pointer 
    -(I'm thinking about just a simple _ at the start of the name.)
-Actually apply spatialmaps in a useful way
-Only render sprites within the view of the camera (possibly using Overlap(Rect, Rect))
-Give Better Camera Functions Such As A Good Rect (even just cross my fingers and check if the default transform::Rect seems to work?)
-DOCUMENTATION
-Make the README.md file less garbage.
-Fix Line Rendering so its less complete garbage.
-Make everything less garbage...

-So so so much more...
