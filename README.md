# Glewy
Graphics Library Project Built Off Of OpenGL, GLFW, SOIL, and SoLoud/miniaudio for Audio playing.

VERY UNFINISHED

I realized Glewy was taking on too many different tasks.
Its scope had gone far beyond what it was intended for, so I am in the process of breaking its
functionality into a number of different libraries such as substd, AbstractGL, and others.
